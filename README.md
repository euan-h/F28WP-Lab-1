Adam:
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.

Barry:
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.

(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students)

{♬ Playing "Pomp and Circumstance" ♬}

Barry:
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances.

(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)

Barry:
Well, Adam, today we are men.

Adam:
We are!

Barry:
Bee-men.

Adam:
Amen!

Barry and Adam:
Hallelujah!

(Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)

{♬ "Pomp and Circumstance" Ends ♬}

Announcer:
Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

Dean:
Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of......9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!

Adam:
Will we pick our job today?

(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus)

Barry:
I heard it's just orientation.

(Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically loaded into the buses)

Tour Guide:
Heads up! Here we go.

Announcer:
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

Barry:
Wonder what it'll be like?

Adam:
A little scary.
